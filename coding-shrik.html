                        <p>Amman, Jordan - the scent of cardamom coffee mingles with the hum of coding, while the ancient whispers of Petra echo in my dreams. This has been my life for the past week and a half - an MIT student trading algorithms for hummus, trading calculus for the captivating chaos of a sun-soaked marketplace. My placement into Jordan was actually more spontaneous than the rest of the cohort, as I didnâ€™t join until late November. But nevertheless, as the halfway mark approaches and I reflect on my time in Amman, I know that there was no better way to spend my IAP.

                                <p>	Today is my second Monday here and also the second day of the academic week. Unlike the US, weeks here run from Sunday through Thursday, making Friday and Saturday the weekend. Today my campus is the charming Rumi Cafe, where intricate tile mosaics become my backdrop for crafting computer science lessons for the next day. A typical weekday will usually consist of teaching from 10AM - 3PM, a debrief meeting with the team from 3PM - 4PM, exploring the city and grabbing dinner until around 9PM, and then heading back to our hotel to prepare curriculum for tomorrow (usually late into the night). On this particular day, however, a group of us decided to head to a cafe to knock out some curriculum for the week. Pictured below is a mirror selfie (PC to Natalie) of us featuring Sophie shoving cake in my mouth and the outdoor patio at the cafe

                                    After about 3 hours of hard work, we decided to wander the streets to find a place for dinner. Even finding dinner becomes an adventure, thanks to Natalie's intrepid spirit and fearlessness approaching people on the street. Forget Yelp reviews, we get the best dinner recommendations directly from a friendly local, leading us to the hidden gem that is Rakwet Arab Restaurant. Not only was the food delicious but the vibes of the restaurant were immaculate, filled with beautiful relics. The table we sat at even had cash from many different countries. And oh, the Om Ali! Creamy bread pudding studded with nuts and raisins, it's been my favorite dessert so far and I've been ordering it whenever I get the chance.

                                    Tuesday night brought a culinary journey of a different kind, a feast of Lebanese flavors at Karam Beirut. David, the director of MISTI Middle East, flew in earlier in the day and invited us out to a wonderful dinner, and let me tell you, the lamb kabobs practically melted in our mouths. Each bite was a testament to the warmth of Jordanian hospitality, a symphony of spices and tenderness. 
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                Amidst the wonderful food and Davidâ€™s warm company, we found ourselves engrossed in reflective and appreciative conversations about the unique position we were in. The initial excitement and anticipation had led us to Jordan, but little did we expect to fall head over heels for the country, its welcoming people, and the incredible teaching program.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One aspect that stood out amidst our cultural exploration was the diversity we encountered, both within Jordan and within our own teaching team. While I anticipated the rich diversity in Jordan due to its historical and geographical significance, what truly took me by surprise was the incredible diversity within our tight-knit group of educators. We hailed from very different corners of MIT and we concluded that many of us would not have met if it wasnâ€™t for the program. But even despite how different we all are, I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better group of people to spend my IAP with and always find myself belly full of laughter with them. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This is Jordan, a land where the past and present weave a captivating tapestry. From the tech startups buzzing with innovation to the ancient ruins breathing history, it's a constant dance between lines of code and lines of time. The days are filled with eager faces in our computer science lessons, their eyes twinkling with the spark of possibility. Each interaction is a treasure, a reminder that the language of curiosity transcends borders.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                So yeah, maybe my textbooks have been replaced by travel guides and my whiteboard markers by Knafeh crumbs. But who needs equations when you have the rhythm of Arabic conversation and the warmth of Karak Tea? This Jordanian adventure is teaching me more than any lecture ever could, reminding me that the greatest lessons are often learned outside the classroom, with a full belly and a heart full of wonder.

                                            Hi, Iâ€™m Shrika, a current Sophomore at MIT studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. My background is in building embedded ML drone systems for remote consciousness assessment using computer vision and natural language processing. My recent research involves combining Eurlian Video Magnification and sensor fusion techniques for the early detection of forest fires. Outside of the technology realm, I really enjoy powerlifting, reading, photography, backpacking, learning languages (I speak 5 currently), and hiking! Itâ€™s a pleasure to travel to Jordan for the first time and I am so excited to meet everyone!
                                        </p>
