                                <p>	Hello, I'm Sophie Guo, a current Masters of Engineering in EECS (Electrical Engineering & Computer Science) student at MIT. I recently graduated with my undergraduate degree at MIT as well, with a double major in Biological Engineering and EECS. In terms of my academic and research interests, I'm particularly interested in how we can harness the power of machine learning techniques to help scientists better understand the complexity and intricacy of biology, whether it be towards understanding genomic data to predict and develop better drugs or understanding cellular mechanisms. With the rapid advancement of DNA/RNA sequencing technology, biological data is being generated at a rate that is far surpassing our ability to process it, resulting in a great demand for computational techniques to process and help scientists develop data-driven insights in biological exploration. Outside of the realm of computational biology, I enjoy hobbies such as figure skating, improving my dancing skills, traveling, photography, and learning to cook new foods! Super excited to meet you all and learn more about your beautiful culture and country!
                                </p>

                        <p>As we were driving, the rain started to let up and the fog steadily got thicker to the point where 
                            you could see roughly 5-10 feet in front of you and no more. The driver put on our hazards and all the other 
                            cars had put theirs on too. I think this may be the thickest fog I have ever driven in - most of the other cars 
                            just looked like blurry halos of light until we got within a couple feet of them, which was pretty disorienting. 
                            But the driver didn’t seem too phased by it. </p>

                        </div>

                            <p>
                                As we got closer to Amman, the fog started to lift. Around 5:30am, we reached the Landmark Hotel, which is where 
                                we will be staying and teaching. It was still dark, but there’s a 24 hour receptionist, and they let me know that 
                                if I could stay awake for an hour, the breakfast buffet would open. I was pretty bone-tired at that point, so I bid 
                                farewell to the driver, and headed to bed. Here’s a quick picture of the view from my room in the pre-dusk light!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I set myself an alarm for 9am, so that I could take advantage of the hotel breakfast before it closed. The breakfast 
                                is extensive! There’s a whole table with labneh and hummus and pickled vegetables and various salads, so I had a much 
                                more nutritious breakfast than I normally do (my default is oatmeal with nothing in it, but maybe this month I’ll level up).
                            </p>

                            <div class="wrap-left">

                                </figure><!--.blog-page-inline-img-->

                            <p>
                                Once I finished breakfast, I took a little bit of time to explore the hotel. It’s very nice! We have access to a gym and a nice 
                                terrace on the second floor. From our rooms you can see views of the Jabal Al Lweibdeh neighborhood - here’s a picture of the 
                                view from my room, this time in the daylight. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The first of the other instructors started arriving around midday. I ended up spending most of the day napping and working on my 
                                curriculum, but when it came time for dinner, Kinan and I took a walk over to Abdali Boulevard, which is a trendy shopping area 
                                that’s about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We walked past a bunch of shops with baklava and other sweets - I’m a big dessert 
                                aficionado so I’m looking forward to trying all the desserts here! 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                I’m looking forward to exploring the city more with my fellow instructors in the weeks to come :)
