                            If youâ€™d asked me at the beginning of the year what I looked forward to the most in Jordan, my answer would have been â€“ exploring the country. But sometime during the three weeks of the program, there was a switch, and if you ask me now what Iâ€™ll miss most or what was my favorite part of the program, my answer, without a doubt, will be the friends I made. So I welcome you to join me in reflecting on my journey and figuring out at what point the switch turned and shifted my mindset :)

                                    Kids, to truly unravel the story and paint a vivid picture of how everything unfolded, we need to go back to the Fall of 2023, when thirteen MIT students were chosen to teach in Jordan (GPTâ€™s take on how Ted Mosby would start this). We had multiple training sessions, and the participants were from all Arab World programs, so I didnâ€™t really get to know who was going to be in Jordan until I got to Jordan. The groups of students chosen to participate in MISTI Arab World were very diverse and from different class years, and I had only met a few people before. Throughout those meetings, my focus was mainly on preparing for the trip, and I only got to meet a few people, most of whom werenâ€™t even doing GTL Jordan.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I usually travel with friends, so coming to Jordan without knowing the other instructors was a bit unnerving. I was also worried about how people would regard me in Jordan and if Iâ€™d feel isolated. With these thoughts in mind, I boarded a plane from Dubai to Amman and hoped for the best. I must confess, the flight was one of the more unpleasant ones for me. A middle-aged man who didnâ€™t speak English ordered me, pointing his finger to move my seat so his family could get an aisle seat. While waiting for my baggage, I had to stand near women because the men kept pushing each other and me to retrieve bags from the carousel, which turned out not to be theirs. By the end of the night, I felt exhausted and lost, telling myself that I should just focus on teaching and try to explore the city as much as I could.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    With this mindset, I spent the next few days trying to meet people and ventured out of the hotel to explore to the fullest. However, I didnâ€™t put extra effort into my relationships with others, as I didnâ€™t have any expectations of forming close bonds.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The natural question is, what changed my heart? I think the answer is the magic of the Boulevard. There were three days and three events in particular that changed my heart, and it all goes back to the Boulevard: this street with many shops and food options, only a 7-minute walk away from the hotel. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The first event was when some of the girls (and Kinan :DD) went to the Mall near the Boulevard to shop for clothes because we realized laundry was expensive, and we simply needed a reason to get new clothes. I think giving advice on what to buy while pampering each other was such a great way to bond!

                                    The second time, I was feeling under the weather, so one of the staff members from Injaz offered to take me in his car. Till then, I hadn't interacted with the staff at all aside from introductions, but during the ride, I got to learn more about two of the staff members. Though I was pretty exhausted, their jokes and stories lifted my mood, and soon I felt energized. Once we arr`ived at the Boulevard, we joined the other instructors and students for lunch, where I got to meet even more people and started enjoying myself more and more.

                                    The third time the Boulevard worked its magic was the next day when I joined some of the other instructors for lunch and later for an evening stroll and a small bite. On that day, I hung out with the instructors I had spent the least amount of time with previously, and by the end of the night, I had befriended all the other instructors, and the feelings of shyness and worries about being isolated all faded away. You can tell that something switched in life when you look at your photos and see the spike in group pictures and a wide and honest smile on everyoneâ€™s faces.

                                    From then on, the fun was on! We went to lots of cafes, restaurants, lounges, and bars, played board games in each otherâ€™s rooms (cough, Sophie and Melissaâ€™s room), and on the bus to and from our next adventure. We did karaoke, and we did it twice because we just love dueting and singing in a group. We made a separate group chat for memes and inside jokes and did our best to take awkward photos of each other (well, some of us did a great job of hiding from the camera). Together, we learned how to dance, and whoever shied away, we dared them to solo dance whenever they lost a bet. We also spent a lot of time arguing over whoâ€™s going to pay because Jordanians love treating their guests, and we love our Jordanian friends! We lived, loved, laughed, and I miss it all so much â€” the cafes, the jokes, the dances, and how we opened up our hearts.

                                        And yes, itâ€™s common for friendships to come to an end soon after the one common thing everyone had is over. But weâ€™re going strong, and our friends from Jordan still text us about their new classes, and we congratulate them for reaching the final of the Asian Cup. And those of us who are currently at MIT randomly started sniping each other whenever we caught sight of another Jor-daayyuummm-er. So now I have to hide from cameras even on campus!!

                                            Hello:) My name is Natalie, and I am a Master of Engineering (MEng) student at MIT. I also got my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from MIT in June 2023. I currently work in the MATCHA (Microarchitecture ATtacks and CHAllenges) Group at CSAIL, led by Assistant Professor Mengjia Yan. As part of the group, my work focuses on developing a framework that will help detect hardware vulnerabilities by enhancing CPU fuzzing. I am passionate about computer systems in general, including security, networks, etc. Additionally, I love algorithms and have been a Teaching Assistant for the course Introduction to Algorithms at MIT for the past year. Outside of school, I enjoy reading (recently have been enjoying historical fiction), design and photography, and traveling. I like to learn about new cultures through books, documentaries, and most of all, by talking to the locals, so I am very excited to visit Jordan and get to meet you all!
